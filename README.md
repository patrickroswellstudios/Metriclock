#Metriclock

Base 1000 MacOS Menubar clock. The perfect clock for OSX 10.10.

Does only the one thing. Click on it for the menu, which also only has one quit item.

This was mostly a Obj-C learning experiment in 2010 and has no redeeming value. As such, I make no claims about the quality of the code, or how up to date it is. The compiled binary still works, at least.

Uses the International Date Line as the 000 point, in an effort to be less parochial than Swatch's metric watch.

You can also switch it to base 10000, but I personally think that ticks too fast. (8.64 seconds) I don't have the seconds showing on the normal clock either, so that might just be me.

#setup
* Have Mac, XCode. Even if you don't develop for the Mac or iOS, XCode comes with a number of nice tools.
* Open the project in xcode, build, then run the app.
